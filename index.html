      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Kerala Blasters FC, fondly known as "The Blasters," is a professional football club based in Kochi, Kerala,
        India, that competes in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top tier of Indian football. Established in 2014, the
        club has rapidly ascended to become one of the most popular and well-supported teams in Asia, boasting a
        passionate fan base known as the "Manjappada" or "Yellow Army."
      </p>
      <P>
        The Blasters' journey began during the inaugural season of the ISL, where they made an immediate impact,
        reaching the finals but narrowly losing to ATK in extra time. Despite the heartbreak, the club's attacking flair
        and unwavering spirit ignited a passionate fan following, establishing a formidable reputation in Indian
        football. Their home matches at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi became a spectacle, drawing
        record-breaking crowds that roared with every touch, every tackle, every goal.
      </P>
      <P>
        Driven by the unwavering support of their loyal fans, the Blasters continued to challenge for glory in the
        following seasons. They reached the finals twice more, in 2016 and 2022, but ultimately fell short of the
        ultimate prize on both occasions. Despite these setbacks, the club's determination and the fervent support of
        their fan base have cemented their status as a powerhouse in Indian football. The Blasters remain a force to be
        reckoned with, aiming to bring home the coveted ISL championship in the years to come.</p>
      </P>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2014, the Kerala Blasters FC swiftly emerged as a powerhouse in the Indian Super League (ISL),
        capturing the hearts of football enthusiasts. Co-owned by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and entrepreneur
        Prasad V. Potluri, the club's inaugural season in 2014 marked a remarkable journey to the finals, symbolizing
        its competitive prowess. Under coach David James, the team's spirited performances resonated with fans, despite
        falling short against ATK. The Blasters continued to impress in subsequent seasons, maintaining a strong fan
        base known as the Manjappada. The 2016 season witnessed a second consecutive appearance in the finals,
        reinforcing the club's resilience but ending in another heartbreak against ATK. The team's consistency, both on
        the field and in fan engagement, solidified its status as a prominent force in Indian football.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the seasons unfolded, the Kerala Blasters experienced a series of coaching changes and varying degrees of
        success. The unwavering support from the passionate Manjappada fan base, however, remained a constant. The
        club's commitment to fostering a unique football culture in Kochi, evident in the vibrant atmosphere during home
        matches, showcased the enduring impact of the Kerala Blasters on the Indian football landscape. Beyond my last
        knowledge update in January 2022, the club's story has likely seen further developments, making it advisable to
        refer to more recent sources for the latest updates on the Kerala Blasters FC.
